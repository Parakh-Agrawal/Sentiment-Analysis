Dataset
The dataset consists of customer reviews collected from various sources. Each review is labeled with its sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.

Data format: CSV file with columns review and sentiment.

Sample data:

review	sentiment
This product is amazing!	positive
I am not satisfied with the service.	negative
The item is okay, nothing special.	neutral
Data Preprocessing
Loading the dataset: Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Text cleaning: Remove punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words.
Removing stop words: Remove common words that do not contribute to the sentiment.
Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the distribution of sentiments, the most common words in each sentiment category, and other relevant insights.

Word clouds: Visualize the most frequent words in positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
Sentiment distribution: Plot the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
Review length analysis: Analyze the length of reviews and their relation to sentiment.
Model Building
Feature extraction: Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model selection: Experiment with different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Training: Train the models on the preprocessed dataset.
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize the model parameters to improve performance.
